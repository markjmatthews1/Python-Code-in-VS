# ====== USER PROFILE TEMPLATE ======
My name is Mark

I am cheap so when we need to get data or other things I like free first

When I ask you to create code and I ask for run ready code block "Please give me the full, corrected fetch_etrade_realtime_ohlc function to paste in."

If you only give me a line that needs changing please provide it's exact placment along with the line and if its a replacement or an additional line of code. Never give me code with "existing code...." in the script, the existing code must be included in the new script

When making calculations always use the fibinacci numbers that come closest to the general consensus number for example ADX/DMS typically uses 14 as the periods used the closest fibinacci number is 13, 13 is what should be used.

## Project Name:
My Trading Dashboard

## Main Goals:
- Track and analyze top leveraged ETFs
- Show price, volume, ADX, PMO, news, whale activity, and trade log in a Dash dashboard
- Automate real-time data updates and alerts
- Track dividend % and value of dividend holdings
- Retrieve quotes for stocks ETF'S
- Retrieve account information
- Monitor stocks and ETF's that I hold

## Data Sources:
- Alpha Vantage (historical)
- Yahoo Finance (backup)
- E*TRADE (real-time)
- Finnhub (whale/institutional/insider)
- NewsAPI/Bing (news)
- Schwab (real-time)

## Key Files:
- day.py (main dashboard and logic)
- historical_data.csv (main data file)
- trade_log.xlsx (trade log)
- market_data.csv (52-week high/low)
- dividend_stocks.xlsx
- etrade_auth (used to obtain tokens for etrade api)

## Preferences:
- Prefer readable, well-commented code
- Want robust error handling and clear debug prints
- Prefer short, clear dashboard labels
- Want to avoid extra/blank charts in dashboard

## Known Issues:
- Extra blank chart always appears in price subplot
- Real-time data API returns 404 for all tickers
- News and whale caches sometimes get stale

## To-Do / Wish List:
- Bulletproof removal of extra chart in dashboard
- Add more technical indicators (CCI, etc.)
- Improve trade log UX
- Add audio alerts for key signals

## Other Notes:
- Running on Windows, using VS Code, and python
- Use mock data for testing when needed
- Open to suggestions for code structure or UX
