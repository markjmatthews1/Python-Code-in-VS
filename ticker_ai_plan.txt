Key Steps for Building Your Ticker Ranking AI and Machine Learning app

Make sure code is well documented

App is called ai_module.py

Gets data from data_provider.py

==========================
Progress & Next Steps
==========================

✅ Step 1: Feature extraction and normalization complete
✅ Step 2: Model training and ranking code scaffolded and tested

➡️ Next up:
- Test model training with more historical data (ideally with real profit/loss labels)
- Refine the labeling logic for “profitable” trades
- Integrate live ranking into the GUI or a scheduled script
- Add error handling and logging for production use

1. Model Validation (should come right after training)
Split your historical data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
Train on the training set, evaluate on the validation set, and print metrics.
2. Model Saving (after validation)
Save your trained model to disk so you can reload it for live predictions.
3. Real-Time Prediction Integration
Add a function to fetch real-time data, extract features, and use the saved model to make predictions/rankings.

✅ Step 1: Define Features for ML Model
•	Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV) once real-time data is available.
•	Bid-Ask spread for liquidity analysis.
•	Moving averages (SMA, EMA) for trend detection.
•	Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD for momentum signals.
•	Real-time order book depth (if Schwab provides it).
✅ Step 2: Select a Machine Learning Approach
•	Random Forests or XGBoost: Great for ranking models based on historical patterns.
•	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): If you want to factor in sequential time-series behavior.
•	Transformer-based models: Could give high adaptability for real-time adjustments.
✅ Step 3: Data Preprocessing & Pipeline Setup
•	Pull historical & real-time market data from Schwab.
•	Normalize values (standardize indicators for better model learning).
•	Use feature engineering to extract market signals relevant to ranking.
✅ Step 4: Model Training & Live Predictions
•	Train the model on past market trends.
•	Feed incoming tickers and rank them based on profitability probability.
•	Generate buy/sell confidence levels for each ticker.
✅ Step 5: Deployment & Live Strategy Integration
•	Run live inference, dynamically updating ranks as new data flows in.
•	Tune model parameters based on real-time market movement feedback.

1. Expanded Feature Set
•	Volatility indicators: ATR (Average True Range), Bollinger Bands width.
•	Calendar features: Day of week, time of day, market open/close proximity.
•	News sentiment: If available, use NLP on news headlines or social sentiment.
•	Sector/industry performance: Relative strength vs. sector/market.
•	Event flags: Earnings, dividends, splits, Fed announcements, etc.
•	Custom signals: Your own rules or signals (e.g., gap up/down, volume spikes).
2. Data Management
•	Robust data pipeline: Handle missing data, outliers, and data lags.
•	Backtesting framework: Simulate trades on historical data to validate strategies.
•	Data labeling: For supervised learning, label data with “profitable”/“not profitable” or regression targets (e.g., future return).

3. Model Management
•	Model versioning: Track which model is in production, and keep logs of predictions.
•	Hyperparameter tuning: Use grid/random search or Bayesian optimization.
•	Ensemble methods: Combine predictions from multiple models for robustness.
________________________________________
4. Risk & Money Management
•	Position sizing: Integrate Kelly criterion, volatility targeting, or fixed fractional sizing.
•	Stop-loss/take-profit logic: Model can suggest optimal exit points, not just entries.
•	Drawdown monitoring: Alert or halt trading if losses exceed a threshold.
________________________________________
5. Live Integration & Monitoring
•	Real-time monitoring: Track model performance, latency, and prediction drift.
•	Fallback logic: If model confidence is low or data is missing, revert to rule-based logic or “no trade.”
•	Logging & audit: Store all predictions, trades, and outcomes for review.
________________________________________
6. Extensibility for Longer-Term Trades
•	Multi-timeframe features: Add daily/weekly indicators alongside intraday.
•	Holding period prediction: Model can suggest not just “buy/sell” but “hold for X days.”
•	Regime detection: Detect bull/bear/sideways markets and adapt strategy.
________________________________________
7. Compliance & Safety
•	Paper trading mode: For safe testing before going live.
•	Order validation: Double-check orders before sending to broker.
•	Rate limiting: Avoid API bans or excessive trading.
________________________________________
8. Documentation & Usability
•	Clear API: Your ai_module.py should have a simple function like get_ticker_ranking(tickers, features) returning ranked tickers and confidence.
•	Configurable parameters: Allow easy tuning of thresholds, features, and model choice.
