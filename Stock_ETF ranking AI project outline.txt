AI Leveraged ETF Ranker – Project Outline
Goal
*	Predict and rank the top 5 leveraged ETFs (and optionally stocks) likely to perform best for the 
current or next day.
*	Display these in the day.py dashboard with their rank and relevant data.
*	Make the system flexible for both short-term and longer-term gain predictions.
 
Data Requirements
a. Historical Price Data
*	Daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for leveraged ETFs and optionally stocks.
*	At least 1–2 years of history for robust modeling.
b. ETF/Stock List
*	List of leveraged ETFs (e.g., TQQQ, SQQQ, SOXL, LABU, SPXL, etc.).
*	Optionally, a broader list for longer-term stock/ETF picks.
c. Market/News/Indicator Data (Optional, for better accuracy)
*	Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc.).
*	Market sentiment/news (optional, advanced).
*	Economic calendar/events (optional).
d. Data Sources
*	Yahoo Finance (yfinance Python package)
*	Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or other APIs (for more/different data)
*	Your own trade history (optional, for personalization)
 
AI/ML Model Design
a. Feature Engineering
*	Calculate technical indicators from price data.
*	Create features for recent returns, volatility, volume spikes, etc.
b. Model Selection
*	Start with regression (predict next-day % return) or classification (up/down).
*	Use scikit-learn (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.) for prototyping.
*	Optionally, try deep learning (LSTM, etc.) for advanced modeling.
c. Training & Validation
*	Train on historical data, validate on recent unseen data.
*	Save the trained model for fast inference.
 
Prediction & Ranking
*	For each ETF/stock, predict next-day (or short-term) return.
*	Rank all candidates by predicted return or probability of gain.
*	Select the top 5 leveraged ETFs (or stocks) for display.
 
Integration with day.py Dashboard
a. API/Interface
*	The AI module should expose a function (e.g., get_top_etf_ranks()) that returns a list of top 5 tickers 
with their predicted rank/score.
b. Display
*	day.py imports and calls the AI module, then displays the results in the dashboard.
 
Flexibility for Longer-Term Picks
*	Allow the module to switch between short-term (1-day) and longer-term (e.g., 1-week, 1-month) 
prediction modes.
*	Parameterize the prediction horizon.
 
Extensibility
*	Easy to add new ETFs, stocks, or features.
*	Optionally, allow user feedback to improve recommendations.
 
Files/Modules to Build
*	ai_ranker.py – The main AI/ML module for data fetching, feature engineering, prediction, and 
ranking.
*	day.py – Your dashboard app, which will import and use ai_ranker.py.
*	requirements.txt – List of required Python packages (yfinance, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.).
 
Summary of Steps
1.	Gather and clean historical data for leveraged ETFs.
2.	Engineer features and build/train a predictive model.
3.	Save the model and create a function to rank ETFs daily.
4.	Integrate the ranking function into your dashboard.
5.	(Optional) Expand to longer-term picks and more asset types.
